## Hi there 👋

I'm Yashwanth Motamarri, a data-driven professional passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive better decision-making. With hands-on experience in SQL, Excel, Tableau, R, and Power BI, I bring a versatile skill set from both corporate and academic settings.

Currently employed as a Business Analyst at Centurion, I assist in system optimization, stakeholder engagement, and dashboard reporting to enhance business performance. My past roles have involved statistical analysis, client engagement analytics, and developing visualizations that inform business strategy.

🧠 Skilled in **SQL, R, Power BI, Tableau, Excel**, and **Google Data Analytics tools**, I enjoy working across the data pipeline: from wrangling datasets to visualizing insights in interactive dashboards.

🎓 Certified in Google Data Analytics and Power BI Associate, I continually work on upskilling and applying analytical tools to real-world challenges.
